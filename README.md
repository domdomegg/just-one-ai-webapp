Watch large language models try to play the board game [Just One](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one), a cooperative word game. In this game:

- AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) take turns being the "guesser"
- The other AI models provide one-word clues for a random mystery word
- Duplicate clues are eliminated before the guesser sees them
- The guesser tries to identify the mystery word based on the remaining unique clues
- Points are scored for correct guesses across multiple rounds
